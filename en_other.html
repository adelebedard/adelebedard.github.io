               <p>Last fall, I took a video game elective. It was an elective for non-programming people, so I just learned the basics of unity, without the code associated to it, even though I did look at it to understand it. I created 4 grounds, focusing on the ambiances created by it. I did not like the fact that what we had to do was purely esthetic, I would have liked to play more with possibles actions of the character or the other components.</p>

               <p>In the context of the course "Tangible media and physical computing", I created a ball that plays music when thrown. My goal was to create a playful object, that would incite to play differently.</p>
                <p>To do this, I used Arduino, with an IMU, which measures acceleration, magnetism and angular speed, with an amplifier and speakers inside the ball.</p>

               <p>In the context of a summer workship, I worked at the creation of a website for the Association des mentors et partenaires de rétablissement, which is a non-profit organisation that employs people suffering from problematics of mental health, to help them reintegrate the working sphere. Presided by Jean-François Pelletier, searcher at Université de Montréal, the organisation does, among other things, research on recovery in mental health. Since I did not know the organisation beforehand, I had, to write the content of the website, to question the employees to understand their vision of the organisation, to be able to make a website that would resemble them. I also participated to the creation of short videos on recovery in mental health. I mostly did the editing, since I had a certain experience, but I also learned texts to deliver them in front of the camera.</p>

               <p>Before doing Cégeps en spectacle, I participated two times to Secondaire en spectacle. The first year, I composed a song, voice and guitar. The second year, I choreographed a dance, with two friends. We won the first place of the creation category at the local final, which allowed us to present our choreography to the regional final. </p>

               <p>In 9th and 11th grade, I participated to the souvenir video committe of my school. In 9th grade, I learned the basic techniques of video creation and edited a video for the Christmas show. In 11th grade, I participated to the creation of the souvenir video, that was ditributed among our cohort. My task has been to search and edit all the archives from the year 2013-2014. </p>

           <p>Wow! You have found the hidden text! I am sorry for this inconvenient. However, I wonder why you were searching to select a block of black... Yeah, on second thought, I am not sorry at all, it is all your fault. To whoever is reading this, you are special. Treat people with kindness, respect and have fun in your life. Starting today, see positive: see the sun, and if there is none, see the benefits of the rain.</p>
