               <p>In fall 2018, I attended a web course within my Computation Arts program. I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript (with JQuery). Here is my personal page, where all my works for this course were situated.</p>

               <p>Here is my final project in my web creation course. I decided to do a project aiming to make users realize the omnipresence of child labour in our everyday life. For that, my website asks the user to compose their usual breakfast, by dragging and dropping aliments in the plate. Then, they can see the proportion of children who work for their breakfase, where do these children come from and the number of children that may be involved in their breakfast's production. They can after modify their breakfast as they want, and see these values change in reel-time.</p>

           <p>Wow! You have found the hidden text! I am sorry for this inconvenient. However, I wonder why you were searching to select a block of black... Yeah, on second thought, I am not sorry at all, it is all your fault. To whoever is reading this, you are special. Treat people with kindness, respect and have fun in your life. Starting today, see positive: see the sun, and if there is none, see the benefits of the rain.</p>
