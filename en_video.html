               <p>For this project, I wanted to represent the perception of human movement by our brain. I liked this idea of the eye being the intermediate between the brain and the outside world, kind of like a camera that would record every frame for the brain to put it together. I was trying to represent what would happen if we could see the intermediate states of the analysis of movement. What happens in the brain for the movement to be analysed.  </p>

               <p>What are picturing the children playing with the game Clue when they imagine the murders? How has this changed in time? </p>
                <p> This work explores the question of the evolution of the representation of violence in movies and TV, through the eyes of children. I use the game Clue as a conductive thread. The characters that appear directly on the board represent what the two girls imagine at that moment, when they think about the murder in the game.   </p>

               <p>Junior Ballet is very important in my life. Firstly, I dance there since I am 4 year old, at a rate of now 10 hours a week, in ballet, jazz and contemporary. Secondly, since now 3 years, the directors offered me the possibility of directing videos linked to the school, that are presented on their website and in front of 800 people at the end of year show, which has been a great way for me to gain experience in the video production domain.</p>
               <p>In the year 2017-2018, they asked me to do the promotional video of the school’s dance company, the Junior Ballet Compagnie. They were in charge of the choreography and they came up with the concept, but I filmed it, deciding all the angles and the way I wanted each sequence to be filmed, and edited it, ajusting it to their vision when needed. So, I learned how to accomplish a project in collaboration with others, respecting a client’s vision. I used Adobe Premiere Elements 15 to edit this.</p>

               <p>In my final year of highschool, we had to do a project of any type that we would work on all year. I decided to produce a documentary on my dance school. I prepared and recorded interviews with dancers from 9 to 25 years old, filmed dance classes and edited it to form a 35 minutes documentary. After they saw it, the directors of the school asked me to prepare a shorter version for them to present in their show. Therefore, I made a 7 minutes version of it that was presented in front of 800 people. The video that is attached to this is an extract of this last version. I used iMovie to edit this. </p>
