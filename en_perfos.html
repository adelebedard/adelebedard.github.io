               <p>The contest « Cegep en spectacle » allows Cegep students to produce themselves on a stage, doing any form of art that they want. The only restrictions are that it has to be less than 10 minutes and in French. That formula really inspired me, because I could do anything I wanted. Each year, I chose a theme and explored how I could deliver the message or story I wanted to tell, including practically every form of art. The first year, I explored the theme of timidity, because it is something that I have been struggling with my whole life. I wanted to say that I did not have to express myself only with words, but I could do it with art and non-verbal communication. I chose to use juggling balls to represent the words, so I juggle with them, trying to be confident with them, but it does not work very well, so I throw them away and start dancing, feeling more free.</p>

               <p>The second year, I decided to tell the story of someone who has an incurable disease and to represent the emotions that she feels when she learns that dhe has only a couple weeks left to live. I chose a song by the « Cowboys Fringants », la tete haute, to be the conductive thread of the piece. I mixed singing, with guitar, and dancing to create a whole piece. The dancing part represents the mix of emotions happening in the protagonist’s mind when she learns the news. The shadow that is appearing at a certain point represents how the character is struggling against her own body, but can’t fight it ; she just has to accept it. I created the video of the shadow using only a white sheet in a doorframe, enlightened with my living room lamp, and I changed the coloration while editing it. </p>

               <p>In the context of my performance art class, I created this instrospective performance, which is the result of a long reflection on my attitude in socal situations. I am a shy person. However, there are certain people with which I feel more comfortable than others. Trying to understand why, I realized that I consider 4 criteria to evaluate if I should be confortable with a certain person: my closeness to this person, their personnality, their interests related to mine and my inferior complex relating to them. </p>
               <p>I decided to implement these criteria in a program, which would, at random moments, create and add a person to the environment. When calculating the total level of comfort, it would produce a color, from red to blue, as well as a music based on the criteria. If I did this project again, I would not add the silhouettes, which are more of a symbol of the masculine gender, which was not my intention, than a symbol of a human being as I wanted. I then wanted to represent my interior reflections with dance.</p>
               <p>To realise that, unconciously, I categorize people that way has helped me to realise that my shyness often doesn't need to be, since I see the absurdity of these categories.</p>

               <p>Still in the context of my performance art class, I created a piece to represent with sounds and movement the way I sometimes see human beings in society. I wanted to create this feeling of stress caused by the acceleration of our lifestyles. I sometimes feel like we are part of a chain, alienated, so I wanted to make the parallel between our way of working and living and factories, machineries. </p>
               <p>I also wanted to play on the idea of space being reduced. The piece starts by taking all the space available, and ends on the center, with no possible way to move from there.</p>

           <p>Wow! You have found the hidden text! I am sorry for this inconvenient. However, I wonder why you were searching to select a block of black... Yeah, on second thought, I am not sorry at all, it is all your fault. To whoever is reading this, you are special. Treat people with kindness, respect and have fun in your life. Starting today, see positive: see the sun, and if there is none, see the benefits of the rain.</p>
