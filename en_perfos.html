               <p>The contest « Cegep en spectacle » allows Cegep students to produce themselves on a stage, doing any form of art that they want. The only restrictions are that it has to be less than 10 minutes and in French. That formula really inspired me, because I could do anything I wanted. Each year, I chose a theme and explored how I could deliver the message or story I wanted to tell, including practically every form of art. The first year, I explored the theme of timidity, because it is something that I have been struggling with my whole life. I wanted to say that I did not have to express myself only with words, but I could do it with art and non-verbal communication. I chose to use juggling balls to represent the words, so I juggle with them, trying to be confident with them, but it does not work very well, so I throw them away and start dancing, feeling more free.</p>

               <p>The second year, I decided to tell the story of someone who has an incurable disease and to represent the emotions that she feels when she learns that dhe has only a couple weeks left to live. I chose a song by the « Cowboys Fringants », la tete haute, to be the conductive thread of the piece. I mixed singing, with guitar, and dancing to create a whole piece. The dancing part represents the mix of emotions happening in the protagonist’s mind when she learns the news. The shadow that is appearing at a certain point represents how the character is struggling against her own body, but can’t fight it ; she just has to accept it. I created the video of the shadow using only a white sheet in a doorframe, enlightened with my living room lamp, and I changed the coloration while editing it. </p>

           <p>Wow! You have found the hidden text! I am sorry for this inconvenient. However, I wonder why you were searching to select a block of black... Yeah, on second thought, I am not sorry at all, it is all your fault. To whoever is reading this, you are special. Treat people with kindness, respect and have fun in your life. Starting today, see positive: see the sun, and if there is none, see the benefits of the rain.</p>
