               <p>I chose to design the sleeves and labels of the record of the soundtrack of the French movie “Le fabuleux destin d’Amélie Poulain”, or “Amélie” in English, by Jean-Pierre Jeunet that came out in 1999.</p>
               <p>My sleeve represents a travel back in memories. The old looking aspect of the suitcase evoques both the epoch, and a promise for an exciting trip, while the fairy in the suitcase when it opens transforms it into a music box, which I think is a strong symbol of happy childhood memories.</p>

              <p>In the context of the midterm project of the design class that I took in fall 2018, we had to, in teams of two, create a diptych, two posters, that would represent the Gotham typeface. </p>
               <p>The first poster represents the geometric aspects of the typeface itself, with these geometric blocks, similar to architectural plans, while the second poster represents the history of this typeface, which is a modern typeface, created in New York in 1999.</p>

           <p>Wow! You have found the hidden text! I am sorry for this inconvenient. However, I wonder why you were searching to select a block of black... Yeah, on second thought, I am not sorry at all, it is all your fault. To whoever is reading this, you are special. Treat people with kindness, respect and have fun in your life. Starting today, see positive: see the sun, and if there is none, see the benefits of the rain.</p>
