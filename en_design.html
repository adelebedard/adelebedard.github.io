               <p>I chose to design the sleeves and labels of the record of the soundtrack of the French movie “Le fabuleux destin d’Amélie Poulain”, or “Amélie” in English, by Jean-Pierre Jeunet that came out in 1999.</p>
               <p>I saw the movie two years ago, and then I downloaded the music and started listening to it intensely. Therefore, for me, the music is not entirely linked with the movie. So, my analysis is more based on the music itself than the movie. But it also works with the movie since the music was created partly for the movie and therefore the ambiance and feeling when listening to it is the same.</p>
               <p>For me, the music alludes to a normal routine that would be enhanced with happiness. In that trail of thoughts, I see this idea of a travel, an activity which would be boring and repetitive but in which the music brings a certain aspect of light and joy. A travel has also a very positive meaning, since it is often the beginning of a new adventure, which really represents the ambiance of the music. Also, since the album is the soundtrack of the movie and it is in order of the scenes in the movie, we can really hear a story progressing even just with the music itself. Therefore, I see this idea of a travel in the meaning of a journey that we are taken on. </p>
               <p>But mostly, the number one feeling that I get when listening to the music is the nostalgia of childhood. Firstly, because all the songs have a light to them, even the sadder ones, which reminds more of the emotions of a child than the emotions of adults. However, we still feel like it comes from an adult’s perspective. </p>
               <p>Also, there are two songs in the record, the only two songs that were not written by Yann Tiersen, that are love songs that have that old 1930s sound. They seem as this was the songs that the character’s parents used to listen to when she was young. </p>
               <p>My sleeve represents a travel back in memories. The ancient looking suitcase really evokes the epoch and this idea of a fun travel, while the fairy in the suitcase when it opens transforms it into a music box, which is I think a strong symbol for childhood happy memories. It also evokes the style of the music that the album has, since it’s the kind of music that we could hear be played in a music box.</p>

              <p>In the context of the midterm project of the design class that I took in fall 2018, we had to, in teams of two, create a diptych, two posters, that would represent the Gotham typeface. </p>
               <p>The first poster represents the geometric aspects of the typeface itself, with these geometric blocks, similar to architectural plans, while the second poster represents the history of this typeface, which is a modern typeface, created in New York in 1999.</p>

           <p>Wow! You have found the hidden text! I am sorry for this inconvenient. However, I wonder why you were searching to select a block of black... Yeah, on second thought, I am not sorry at all, it is all your fault. To whoever is reading this, you are special. Treat people with kindness, respect and have fun in your life. Starting today, see positive: see the sun, and if there is none, see the benefits of the rain.</p>
