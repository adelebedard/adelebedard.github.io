               <p>This project, made with Sol Paul, is a real-time video performance using motion capture, shown through effects in video and accompanying generative sound. Using visual programming in Max, I made particles that follow a certain color, as well as some delay effects that accompanied a scanner effect that my partner made. I am the performer in the sample piece as well.</p>

               <p>Following a class that I took on the relationship between music and dance, I decided to explore how that relationship could be described mathematically or visually. For this, I worked with visual programming in Max to make an analysis of both the dancers, based on amplitude and accents, and the music, based on its volume, separately, and superimpose them to see a relationship emerging.</p>

               <p>This ball that plays music when thrown was designed with the intent to create a playful object, that would encourage people in serious environments to play differently. </p>
               <p>To do this, I used Arduino, with an IMU, which measures acceleration, magnetism and angular speed, with an amplifier and speakers inside the ball.</p>

               <p>In the context of the integrative project of my end of Cegep program, I programmed, with a partner, a scientifically oriented baseball game in Java. I principally did the field view as well as the scientific mode. The exchange of data between the different scenes and the correction of bugs were also part of my main tasks. </p>

               <p>This web-based project aims to make users realize the omnipresence of child labor in our everyday life. For that, my website asks the user to compose their usual breakfast, by dragging and dropping aliments in the plate. Then, they can see the proportion of children who work for their breakfast, where do these children come from and the number of children that may be involved in their breakfast's production. Afterwards, they can modify their breakfast as they wish, and see these values change in real-time.</p>

               <p>This game, made in the Gamerella 2020 game jam, is meant to portray different experiences with depression. It allows the user to explore a story of 8 situations where they can choose which actions to make. It then affects their levels of depression, social interaction, self-esteem and energy. </p>
               <p>I was the only programmer in the team, so I had the task to bring together the artwork, the music and the script into a functioning game. It was made using Javascript, with HTML and CSS.</p>

               <p>For this video project, I wanted to represent the perception of human movement by our brain. I liked this idea of the eye being the intermediate between the brain and the outside world, kind of like a camera that would record every frame for the brain to put it together. I was trying to represent what would happen if we could see the intermediate states of the analysis of movement.   </p>

               <p>This multidisciplinary performance tells the story of someone who has an incurable disease and to represent the emotions that she feels when she learns that she has only a couple weeks left to live. I chose a song by the Cowboys fringants, La tête haute, to be the conductive thread of the piece. The dancing part represents the mix of emotions happening in the protagonist’s mind when she learns the news. The shadow that is appearing at a certain point represents how the character is struggling against her own body but can’t fight it ; she just has to accept it.  </p>

Yeah, on second thought, I am not sorry at all, it is all your fault. To whoever is reading this, you are special. Treat people with kindness, respect and have fun in your life.
